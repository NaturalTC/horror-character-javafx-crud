These are just some notes for myself
-
I was able to figure out AppState, but I still have some issues while editing. If I update the table, it doesn't 
persistent changes.

I added some CSS, I decided to use 2 files for simplicity - I was feeling lazy and didnt want to uniquely Identify each FXML component.
So I use root identifiers to modify all at once.

I never added a listview, instead I opted into using a Table instead. I totally forgot to implement the transformable 
information into the table plus setup verification error pop up for the zombies because they can't transform. 

I also needed to implement verification that a time is entered into the Date component. Pop and error if not as well.
